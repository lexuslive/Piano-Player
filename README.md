# Piano Player

This was a practice project which involved 2 parts:

1. The first was to introcude event handlers where we use onclick events to triger a change in the color for the piano keys. 
2. The second was to introduce some more interactivity by scrolling through the lines that would allow the piano player to see what keys needed to be played as well as the lyrics for the song being played.
